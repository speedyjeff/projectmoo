# Project Moo

This project started as a joint coding project with my youngest son.  We wanted to create a game together that involved survival, crafting, and Zombies.

The project uses C# and a WinForms shell.  This project has an updated game engine (with more refactoring than [shootmup](https://github.com/speedyjeff/shootmup))
